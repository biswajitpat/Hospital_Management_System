# Hospital_Management_System

Hospital Management System is a system enabling hospitals to manage information and data related to all aspects of healthcare – processes, providers, patients, and more, which in turn ensures that processes are completed swiftly and effectively. When one thinks of the various aspects and departments of a hospital, it becomes apparent that an HMS is critical. The hospital database management system was introduced in 1960, and has greatly evolved since then – with the ability to integrate with the existing facilities, technologies, software, and systems of a hospital. Today, patients can begin the process of healthcare in the palm of their hand – the mobile devices and apps – make this possible. This process then moves to the healthcare providers and hospitals.
